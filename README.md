## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problems in Indonesia:**

- Election & organizational voting processes are often non-transparent and prone to manipulation
- Lack of publicly verifiable records
- High costs and logistics for large-scale voting

**Who is affected:**

- General voters who want their votes counted fairly
- Organizations, communities, and DAOs that need secure & efficient voting systems
- Election organizers who want to reduce costs & manipulation risks

**Why this matters:**
Voting integrity determines the quality of democracy. Without transparency and security, election results can be questioned, triggering social instability and reducing participation.

## ⚠️ Current Solutions & Limitations

**Current Solutions:**

- Conventional paper-based systems & manual counting
- Centralized voting applications

**Limitations:**

- Vulnerable to data manipulation
- Not publicly transparent
- High logistical & security costs
- Prone to cyber attacks (for centralized systems)

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**PemiluChain** leverages **Stacks smart contracts** to record every vote **on-chain**, ensuring:

- ✅ **Transparent** – all data publicly available & immutable
- ✅ **Secure** – votes cannot be deleted or altered
- ✅ **Efficient** – no physical logistics, automatic counting
- ✅ **Global access** – voting from anywhere via Stacks wallet
